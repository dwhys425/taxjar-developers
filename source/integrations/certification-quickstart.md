title: Certification Quickstart
description: "Speed up the certification review process! ðŸš€"
---

To expedite the certification review process, you may follow the instructions below once initial development on the integration is complete.

By performing specific [calculations and transactions](#section-calculations-and-transactions) from within the platform you're integrating with TaxJar, our Integrations team will more quickly be able to test that the integration is utilizing the [SmartCalcs Sales Tax API](https://developers.taxjar.com/api/reference) properly and satisfies the [Certification Guidelines](/integrations/certification-guidelines) as well as the [Certification Checklist](/integrations/certification-checklist).<br><br>

### Prerequisites

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; Set up nexus in New York (NY) in the [TaxJar app](https://app.taxjar.com/account#states) or within the platform's nexus management view.</label>

- If supporting [multiple international business addresses](/integrations/sales-tax-calculations/#section-international-limitations) for a merchant, add NY in the nexus management view within the platform, which should send NY as a nexus state via the `nexus_addresses` param when [calculating tax](https://developers.taxjar.com/api/reference/#post-calculate-sales-tax-for-an-order).
â€‹

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensure Maine (ME) is NOT a nexus state.</label>

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; Add product tax code `20010` (Clothing) to an item priced at $109 or less.</label>

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a coupon that discounts a single item by $5.</label>

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an order-level coupon that discounts an entire order by 50%.</label>

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a coupon that enables free shipping. Or, if unavailable:</label>

- Create a shipping coupon of a fixed amount that equals the cost of shipping for the product set up earlier with product tax code `20010`.<br><br>

### Other Tests

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; To save customers on [billing](https://developers.taxjar.com/api/reference/#billing), we will also test if tax calculations are [cached until order details change](/integrations/sales-tax-calculations/#section-api-guidelines).</label>

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; To test for [nexus sync or management](/integrations/certification-checklist/#section-configuration), we will check that a request to [v2/nexus/regions](https://developers.taxjar.com/api/reference/#get-list-nexus-regions) was made, or that all tax calculations pass the `nexus_addresses` param containing a merchant's nexus locations. If the integration supports multiple international business addresses, the `nexus_addresses` param should be used for [international support](https://developers.taxjar.com/api/reference/#countries).</label>

<label><input type="checkbox">&nbsp;&nbsp; After you [submit your integration](/integrations/submit/), we'll then certify other aspects of it, such as:</label>
