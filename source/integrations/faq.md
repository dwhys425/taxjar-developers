## How do I get a sandbox account?

TaxJar provides a sandbox environment on all [TaxJar Professional](https://www.taxjar.com/request-demo/) or higher plans. You can generate a sandbox API token inside the TaxJar app under **Account > TaxJar API**. From there, you can [point your API client](/api/reference/#sandbox-environment) to our sandbox URL at `https://api.sandbox.taxjar.com`.

## What is your API uptime and response times?

Our sales tax API clocks in at sub-75ms with 99.99% uptime. Check our [status page](https://status.taxjar.com/) for more information.

## Does your sales tax API enforce rate limits?

Yes, we do enforce rate limits for SmartCalcs API requests:

- 10,000 requests per minute on [TaxJar Professional](https://www.taxjar.com/request-demo/)
- 25,000 requests per minute on [TaxJar Premium](https://www.taxjar.com/request-demo/)

If you have any concerns about rate limiting, please [contact us](https://www.taxjar.com/contact/).

## How do I reset my API token?

At this time you will need to contact [TaxJar support](https://www.taxjar.com/contact/) to reset your API token. Upon reset, your old token will immediately stop working and you can log in to generate a new token. We plan to offer automatic resets in the near future.
