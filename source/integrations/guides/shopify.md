## How to Connect Your Shopify Store

Shopify's built-in tax engine automatically collects sales tax for you, from wherever you tell it to - even if you have sales tax nexus in more than one state.

To turn on sales tax collection in Shopify, simply go to Settings > Taxes. 

The Shopify Tax Manual quickly and thoroughly walks you through setting up sales tax.

Customers are accustomed to sales tax being added after the fact, and adding sales tax to the price of the item in your store may make your prices appear higher than a competitor’s</p>

    <p><img src="/images/lander/checkmark.svg" class="panel-checkmark" width="20"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Be sure to set your tax overrides</b> – For example, some categories, such as food and clothing, are tax exempt in certain states. Don’t collect sales tax when you don’t have to!</p>
