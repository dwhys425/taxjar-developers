## Sales Tax 101 for eBay Sellers

As an online seller, you want to understand every nuance of your business. Some aspects – like sales tax – can get overwhelming quickly. 

If you fall into this camp, then this quick guide is for you. The goal is to explain **the basics of sales tax for new eCommerce sellers** (or seasoned eCommerce sellers who have questions.) 

Let’s get started:

## The Basics of Sales Tax in the U.S.

Forty-five U.S. states and D.C. levy a sales tax. Merchants in these states are required to charge sales tax to buyers. 

Sales tax is considered a [“pass-through” tax](https://blog.taxjar.com/sales-tax-pass-through-tax/), because the merchant is only holding the taxes collected before remitting it to state and local taxing authorities at a set time (usually either monthly, quarterly or annually.) 

Sales tax is used to fund state projects and initiatives, including schools, roads, public safety departments, etc. 

In the U.S., states have quite a bit of leeway with sales tax administration. Because of this, all 45 states (plus D.C.) that levy a sales tax have different rules and laws when it comes to sales tax. Sales tax rates can vary by state and locality, too. 

One example of how state sales tax rules vary is that some states require you to [charge sales tax on shipping charges](https://blog.taxjar.com/sales-tax-and-shipping/), while others do not. Another example: some states [might require you to renew your sales tax permit](https://blog.taxjar.com/list-states-require-sellers-renew-sales-tax-permits/) periodically, while others do not. 

Even more confusing - some local areas may levy sales tax even in states with no statewide sales tax (such as in Alaska.) 

It’s important to get in touch with your state’s taxing authority or an experienced accounting professional should you have questions about sales tax. [Here’s a map](https://www.taxjar.com/states/) with plenty of info about how to contact each state’s taxing authority.

## Determining Sales Tax Nexus

Online sellers must collect sales tax in states or localities where they have “sales tax nexus.”

While all states have a slightly different definition of this term, sales tax nexus is generally defined as “presence” in a state. This presence must be significant enough so that a business has to comply with the state’s sales tax law

Presence can include – but is not limited to – an office, economic activity in a state, an employee or a warehouse. 

**If you have sales tax nexus** in a state that requires sales tax collection, then you’re required to collect sales tax from all buyers in that state regardless of where the item is shipped from. 

**If you do not have sales tax nexus** in a state, then you’re not required to collect sales tax when you sell online to buyers in that state (regardless from where the item is shipped).

    <div class="panel-title"><b>4 Common Examples of Sales Tax Nexus</b></div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>1. <b>Home state nexus</b> – You live and run your eCommerce business in Texas. Because you have a physical presence in Texas, you have “sales tax nexus” there, and therefore are <a href="https://blog.taxjar.com/amazon-sales-tax-texas/?utm_source=whitepaper&utm_medium=whitepaper%20link&utm_content=required%20to%20collect%20sales%20tax%20from%20buyers%20in%20the%20state%20of%20Texas&utm_campaign=Sales%20Tax%20101%20for%20ALL">required to collect sales tax from buyers in the state of Texas.</a></p>
    <p>2. <b>Employee nexus</b> – You live and run your eCommerce business in the state of Florida, but you hire your sister in Georgia to help you. Because you operate out of Florida and have an employee in Georgia, you now have sales tax nexus in Florida and Georgia and must collect sales tax from buyers in both states.</p>
    <p>3. <b>Economic nexus</b> – “Economic nexus” is when a seller is required to collect sales tax in a state because they make either a certain dollar amount of sales in that state or have a certain number of sales transactions in that state. The most common economic nexus threshold in a state is $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions in a year.  Economic nexus is a fairly new concept, and only about half the U.S. states with sales tax have economic nexus laws, though more states are adding new economic nexus laws and regulations. You can <a href="https://blog.taxjar.com/economic-nexus-laws/">read about each state’s economic nexus laws here</a>. And you can find out where your business has economic nexus by using <a href="/sales-and-transactions-checker/">TaxJar’s Sales & Transactions Checker.</a></p>
    <p>4. <b>Inventory nexus</b> – Most states have ruled – either definitively or vaguely – that <a href="https://blog.taxjar.com/fba-sales-tax-nexus/?utm_source=whitepaper&utm_medium=whitepaper%20link&utm_content=3rd%20party%20fulfillment%20constitutes%20nexus&utm_campaign=Sales%20Tax%20101%20for%20ALL">3rd party fulfillment constitutes nexus</a>. This means that if you store your inventory in a warehouse in a state, then that constitutes sales tax nexus. So if you live in Wisconsin, but store your inventory in California for the purposes of faster shipping, then you have sales tax nexus in both states.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Example #4 can be especially cumbersome for 3rd party sellers, whose inventory may be stored in states other than their home state. Third-party selling, and the associated sales tax registration and filings required, can create a huge administrative burden on unsuspecting eCommerce merchants.

<div class="panel panel-warning">
  <div class="panel-heading">
    <div class="panel-title"><b>Once you’ve determined where you have sales tax nexus, you’re required to do two things:</b></div>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>1. <a href="https://blog.taxjar.com/how-to-register-for-sales-tax-permits/">Obtain a sales tax permit</a> (sometimes called sales tax license) for that state (in the cases of third-party sellers this means acquire a license in every state where you warehouse inventory)</p>
    <p>2. Begin collecting sales tax in that state (most states consider it illegal to collect sales tax without a permit)</p>

## Collecting Sales Tax from Buyers

Every eCommerce business owner wants their business to grow and thrive. You can't grow if you have to manually calculate how much sales tax to collect every time you make a sale. That’s why most online sales platforms must include a sales tax component.

A note on sales tax rates: States set a rate, and then localities can add a percentage on top of those rates. For example, in the 90210 zip code, the tax rate is the 6.5% California statewide rate, a 1% Los Angeles County rate, and an additional 1.5% local rate, for a total of 9.0% sales tax rate. 

Why did we have to put these guides together? Because, unfortunately, collecting sales tax via various online platforms is rarely simple. This is especially true if you collect sales tax at multiple rates, such as is the case for sellers in destination-based states.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  We always caution that you check and double check the sales tax rates that you are charging your customers. Our <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/ebay-tax-rates/">eBay Sales Tax Rates guide</a> will help you determine which sales tax rate to charge on eBay.
</div>

**Origin-Based Sales Tax States and Destination-Based Sales Tax States**

When it comes to determining tax rates, most states fall into one of two major buckets when it comes to sellers with home state nexus: “origin-based” sales tax states and “destination-based” sales tax states.

In layperson’s terms, this means that some states require you to collect sales tax at the rate effective at the point of “origin” (i.e. your office, store or warehouse) while most states require you to collect sales tax at the rate of the “destination” (your buyer’s address.)

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  Keep in mind that the above only applies to your "home state." Most states, with exceptions of California, Arizona and New Mexico, require out-of-state sellers to collect at the rate of the buyer’s ship to address.
</div>

**Origin vs. Destination-Based Sales Tax Examples**

Let’s say you live in (or have a warehouse or office in) Irving, Texas, but sell to someone in Archer City. Texas is an origin-based sales tax state, so you would charge any buyer in the state of Texas your home rate of 8.25%. (That’s Texas’s statewide 6.25% rate plus Irving County’s 1.0% plus a local Dallas MTA rate of 1.00%.) You don’t need to take your buyer’s address in Archer City into account.

![](/images/guides/woocommerce/origin-state-texas.png)

But if you live in Stamford, New York the rules are different. Since New York is a destination-based sales tax state, you’re required to collect sales tax at the effective rate at your buyer’s address. So if you operate your business in Stamford and sell to a buyer in Buffalo, then you are required to charge the seller 8.75% sales tax – the total sales tax rate at their locality in Buffalo. (That’s a New York state base rate of 4.0% plus the Erie County rate of 4.75%).

    <p>We know that some online sellers also sell offline at brick and mortar stores, trade shows, craft fairs, etc. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to lookup a local sales tax rate, check out TaxJar’s <a href="https://www.taxjar.com/sales-tax-calculator/">Sales Tax Calculator</a> as a quick reference.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Once you have determined your sales tax rate and collected sales tax from buyers, you then have to remit the funds you collected to your state(s). (Remember, sale tax is a passthrough tax and you don’t get to keep it!)

    <div class="panel-title"><b>Collecting the right amount of sales tax?</b></div>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>If you’re concerned that you haven’t collected the right amount of sales tax from buyers, TaxJar has a <a href="https://blog.taxjar.com/date-of-first-nexus/">“Detailed Sales Tax Analysis”</a> report that will help. We’ll search your channels and make sure you collected every penny of sales tax you were supposed to collect.</p>

    <p>We also allow you to enter the date you first established sales tax nexus in a state. Users who begin using TaxJar in the middle of a taxable period will appreciate remitting every cent you owe to a state, but not a penny more.</p>

See a problem? You can also click on each state on your TaxJar dashboard and see an [“Expected Sales Tax Due”](https://blog.taxjar.com/expected-sales-tax-collection/) report. This report will show you how much we thought you should have collected in each state and taxing district (city, county, etc.) to help you figure out where the discrepancy lies.

![](/images/guides/woocommerce/florida-expected-sales-tax-due.jpg)

Why is this so important? Sometimes your state can decide to perform a sales tax audit on your business. We’ve heard from many sellers that these audits are more arduous than IRS audits. This is just another reason why it’s so important to get a handle on sales tax early – before the state gets a handle on you!

## Remitting Sales Tax to Nexus States

A state’s taxing authority is generally called the “State Department of Revenue” though it can go by other names. (For example, California’s taxing authority is the “California Department of Tax and Fee Administration.”)

When you apply for your sales tax permit with your state’s taxing authority, they will assign you a frequency at which to file and remit sales tax. This is generally monthly, quarterly or annually, and usually depends on your sales volume in that state.

<div class="alert alert-danger">
  Most states require that you file a sales tax report even if you do not owe sales tax. If you do not file, you could be subject to penalties. Pay close attention to instructions you receive with your sales tax permit.
</div>

**Sales Tax Filing Due Dates**

Be warned that while many states set their sales tax due date as the 20th of the month, states can vary wildly in their sales tax due dates. If you are a quarterly payer, be sure you are aware of which date your state considers a “quarterly” due date. Sales tax filing due dates can vary to a surprising degree. You can check sales tax due dates in every state [here](https://www.taxjar.com/states/).

**How to File Sales Tax Returns**

As with sales tax rules, every state has slightly different requirements for filing sales tax returns. For more details on how to file in each state refer to [state sales tax info](https://www.taxjar.com/states/).

Most states allow you to file and pay online, and some even require it. 

Be warned that some states are harsh taskmasters (usually ones that are destination-based for tax collection like Washington), and require you to report how much sales tax you collected in every single sales tax district. Some states have hundreds of sales tax districts, so this can easily turn into a nightmare – especially if you’re filing in multiple states at a time.

TaxJar has you covered here, too. After you connect your eCommerce accounts to TaxJar, we’ll subtotal your sales and sales tax collected by state, and country, city and special tax when it’s required. With TaxJar, you don’t have to deal with spreadsheets or sales tax tables to try and determine how much sales tax you collected from each jurisdiction.

TaxJar makes filing sales tax in destination-based states like Washington dead simple.

## Sales Tax for eBay Sellers

Now for the nuts and bolts. How can you manage the hassles of sales tax in your eBay store?

**How to Setup Sales Tax Collection on eBay**

Your first step is to set up sales tax collection in your eBay store. We have a [step-by-step guide to setting up eBay sales tax collection here](https://blog.taxjar.com/sales-tax-on-ebay/).

Keep these key recommendations in mind when setting up your eBay sales tax collection:

1. If you live in a destination-based state or have some other reason to charge more than one sales tax rate, use our [eBay Average Sales Tax Rates chart](https://www.taxjar.com/ebay-tax-rates/) to determine which rate to enter in each state.
2. eBay allows you to choose whether or not you will charge sales tax on shipping. Check here to [find out if your state (or states) requires sales tax on shipping](https://blog.taxjar.com/sales-tax-and-shipping/).
3. Keep in mimd that some products (such as food and clothing) are taxed differently in some states. Find your state (or states) in our [sales tax by state guide](https://www.taxjar.com/states) to determine if you are selling any tax exempt or differently taxed items.

**Connecting TaxJar to Your eBay Account**

1. If you haven't already, [sign up for a TaxJar account](https://app.taxjar.com). (There's a 30-day no risk free trial. No credit card required to test TaxJar out!)
2. Connect TaxJar to your eBay account - From your TaxJar dashboard, click Account > Linked Accounts > Connect to PayPal. From here you'll be asked to login to your PayPal account. Do that, and we'll take you to a page asking you to grant permission for TaxJar to access your account. Click "Grant Permission." From here, TaxJar will begin importing your transactions from eBay (PayPal.) This generally takes a couple of hours, but may take longer if you have very high sales volume.
3. If you sell on multiple channels, connect your other accounts with TaxJar. This allows us to pull in all of your online transactions and create return-ready sales tax reports.

**Using TaxJar with your eBay Account**

Once you have TaxJar set up with your eBay Account (and all of the other accounts you sell on) the real magic begins.

When it comes time for you to file your sales tax return, TaxJax has created a return-ready sales tax report so you can quickly and easily file. Just click the state in which you are filing on your [TaxJar Dashboard](https://app.taxjar.com/dashboard).

If you want to take sales tax completely off your plate, TaxJar will also [AutoFile](https://www.taxjar.com/how-it-works) your sales tax returns for you in most states.
