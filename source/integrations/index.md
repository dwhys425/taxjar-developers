Building a custom integration with TaxJar? In these guides, we’ll cover everything you need to know about handling sales tax calculations, reporting, and filing for your own platform. Before you build a new integration from scratch, we recommend reading these guides and browsing our [API documentation](/api/reference/) so you fully understand what can be accomplished through the [TaxJar API](https://www.taxjar.com/api/), our sales tax API.
